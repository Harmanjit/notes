abstract = {Stringent alarmone, namely, guanosine 3'-diphosphate-5'-diphosphate ({ppGpp}), is a global regulator that plays a critical role in the survival, growth, metabolism, and many other vital processes of microorganisms. Because of its structural similarity to normal nucleotides, it is also a challenge for the selective and sensitive detection of {ppGpp} nowadays. Herein, we developed a colorimetric method for the selective detection of {ppGpp} by inhibiting the redox reaction between Fenton-like reagent (composed of Fe(3+) and {H2O2}) with 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) ({ABTS}). Owing to the strong coordination affinity between {ppGpp} and Fe(3+), the chromogenic reaction between {ABTS} and Fenton-like reagent, occurred in aqueous medium at 37 °C and resulted in a bluish-green solution, which was inhibited with the addition of {ppGpp}. This phenomenon forms the basis for the colorimetric detection of {ppGpp}, with a detection limit of 0.19 μM and good selectivity for {ppGpp} over other nucleotides and anions. Furthermore, the results could be visualized by the naked eye, and the sensitivity of the naked-eye observation could even be further improved with the aid of the introduction of a background color.}

abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus frequently invades the human bloodstream, leading to life threatening bacteremia and often secondary foci of infection. Failure of antibiotic therapy to eradicate infection is frequently described; in some cases associated with altered S. aureus antimicrobial resistance or the small colony variant ({SCV}) phenotype. Newer antimicrobials, such as linezolid, remain the last available therapy for some patients with multi-resistant S. aureus infections. Using comparative and functional genomics we investigated the molecular determinants of resistance and {SCV} formation in sequential S. aureus isolates from a patient who had a persistent and recurrent S. aureus infection, after failed therapy with multiple antimicrobials, including linezolid. Two point mutations in key staphylococcal genes dramatically affected clinical behaviour of the bacterium, altering virulence and antimicrobial resistance. Most strikingly, a single nucleotide substitution in {relA} ({SACOL1689}) reduced {RelA} hydrolase activity and caused accumulation of the intracellular signalling molecule guanosine 3', 5'-bis(diphosphate) ({ppGpp}) and permanent activation of the stringent response, which has not previously been reported in S. aureus. Using the clinical isolate and a defined mutant with an identical {relA} mutation, we demonstrate for the first time the impact of an active stringent response in S. aureus, which was associated with reduced growth, and attenuated virulence in the Galleria mellonella model. In addition, a mutation in {rlmN} ({SACOL1230}), encoding a ribosomal methyltransferase that methylates {23S} {rRNA} at position A2503, caused a reduction in linezolid susceptibility. These results reinforce the exquisite adaptability of S. aureus and show how subtle molecular changes cause major alterations in bacterial behaviour, as well as highlighting potential weaknesses of current antibiotic treatment regimens.}

We applied our method to quantify nucleotide pools in Escherichia coli {BW25113} K12-strain both throughout the growth curve and during acute stringent response induced by mupirocin. While {ppGpp} and {pppGpp} levels vary drastically (40- and ≥8-fold, respectively) these changes are decoupled from the quotients of the housekeeping pool and guanosine and adenosine housekeeping nucleotides: {NTP}/{NDP}/{NMP} ratio remains stable at 6/1/0.3 during both normal batch culture growth and upon acute amino acid starvation.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A significant body of evidence accumulated over the last century suggests a link between hypoxic microenvironments within the infected host and the latent phase of tuberculosis. Studies to test this correlation have identified the M. tuberculosis initial hypoxic response, controlled by the two-component response regulator {DosR}. The initial hypoxic response is completely blocked in a {dosR} deletion mutant. {METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: We show here that a {dosR} deletion mutant enters bacteriostasis in response to in vitro hypoxia with only a relatively mild decrease in viability. In the murine infection model, the phenotype of the mutant was indistinguishable from that of the parent strain. These results suggested that additional genes may be essential for entry into and maintenance of bacteriostasis. Detailed microarray analysis of oxygen starved cultures revealed that {DosR} regulon induction is transient, with induction of nearly half the genes returning to baseline within 24 hours. In addition, a larger, sustained wave of gene expression follows the {DosR}-mediated initial hypoxic response. This Enduring Hypoxic Response ({EHR}) consists of 230 genes significantly induced at four and seven days of hypoxia but not at initial time points. These genes include a surprising number of transcriptional regulators that could control the program of bacteriostasis. We found that the {EHR} is independent of the {DosR}-mediated initial hypoxic response, as {EHR} expression is virtually unaltered in the {dosR} mutant. {CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: Our results suggest a reassessment of the role of {DosR} and the initial hypoxic response in {MTB} physiology. Instead of a primary role in survival of hypoxia induced bacteriostasis, {DosR} may regulate a response that is largely optional in vitro and in mouse infections. Analysis of the {EHR} should help elucidate the key regulatory factors and enzymatic machinery exploited by M. tuberculosis for long-term bacteriostasis in the face of oxygen deprivation.}

abstract = {The virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis depends on the ability of the bacilli to switch between replicative (growth) and non-replicative (dormancy) states in response to host immunity. However, the gene regulatory events associated with transition to dormancy are largely unknown. To address this question, we have assembled the largest M. tuberculosis transcriptional-regulatory network to date, and characterized the temporal response of this network during adaptation to stationary phase and hypoxia, using published microarray data. Distinct sets of transcriptional subnetworks (origons) were responsive at various stages of adaptation, showing a gradual progression of network response under both conditions. Most of the responsive origons were in common between the two conditions and may help define a general transcriptional signature of M. tuberculosis growth arrest. These results open the door for a systems-level understanding of transition to non-replicative persistence, a phenotypic state that prevents sterilization of infection by the host immune response and promotes the establishment of latent M. tuberculosis infection, a condition found in two billion people worldwide.}

abstract = {Latency in Mycobacterium tuberculosis poses a barrier in its complete eradication. Overexpression of certain genes is one of the factors that help these bacilli survive inside the host during latency. Among these genes, rel, which leads to the expression of Rel protein, plays an important role by synthesizing the signaling molecule {ppGpp} using {GDP} and {ATP} as substrates, thereby changing bacterial physiology. In Gram-negative bacteria, the protein is thought to be activated in vivo in the presence of ribosome by sensing uncharged {tRNA}. In the present report, we show that Rel protein from Mycobacterium smegmatis, which is highly homologous to M. tuberculosis Rel, is functional even in the absence of ribosome and uncharged {tRNA}. From the experiments presented here, it appears that the activity of Rel(Msm) is regulated by the domains present at the C terminus, as the deletion of these domains results in higher synthesis activity, with little change in hydrolysis of {ppGpp}. However, in the presence of {tRNA}, though the synthesis activity of the full-length protein increases to a certain extent, the hydrolysis activity undergoes drastic reduction. Full-length Rel undergoes multimerization involving interchain disulfide bonds. The synthesis of {pppGpp} by the full-length protein is enhanced in the reduced environment in vitro, whereas the hydrolysis activity does not change significantly. Mutations of cysteines to serines result in monomerization with a simultaneous increase in the synthesis activity. Finally, it has been possible to identify the unique cysteine, of six present in Rel, required for {tRNA}-mediated synthesis of {ppGpp}.}

In Mtb, this response is initiated by the enzymatic action of {RelMtb} and deletion of {relMtb} produces a strain ({H37RvDeltarelMtb}) severely compromised in the maintenance of long-term viability. Although aerosol inoculation of mice with {H37RvDeltarelMtb} results in normal initial bacterial growth and containment, the ability of this strain to sustain chronic infection is severely impaired. Significant histopathologic differences were noted in lungs and spleens of mice infected with {H37RvDeltarelMtb} compared with controls throughout the course of the infection. Microarray analysis revealed that {H37RvDeltarelMtb} suffers from a generalized alteration of the transcriptional apparatus, as well as specific changes in the expression of virulence factors, cell-wall biosynthetic enzymes, heat shock proteins, and secreted antigens that may alter immune recognition of the recombinant organism. Thus, {RelMtb} is critical for the successful establishment of persistent infection in mice by altering the expression of antigenic and enzymatic factors that may contribute to successful latent infection.}

In gram-negative bacteria, (p){ppGpp} is produced by the activity of the related {RelA} and {SpoT} proteins. Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains a single homolog of these proteins (Rel(Mtb)) and responds to nutrient starvation by producing (p){ppGpp}. A rel(Mtb) knockout strain was constructed in a virulent strain of M. tuberculosis, {H37Rv}, by allelic replacement. The rel(Mtb) mutant displayed a significantly slower aerobic growth rate than the wild type in synthetic liquid media, whether rich or minimal. The growth rate of the wild type was equivalent to that of the mutant when citrate or phospholipid was employed as the sole carbon source. These two organisms also showed identical growth rates within a human macrophage-like cell line. These results suggest that the in vivo carbon source does not represent a stressful condition for the bacilli, since it appears to be utilized in a similar Rel(Mtb)-independent manner. In vitro growth in liquid media represents a condition that benefits from Rel(Mtb)-mediated adaptation. Long-term survival of the rel(Mtb) mutant during in vitro starvation or nutrient run out in normal media was significantly impaired compared to that in the wild type. In addition, the mutant was significantly less able to survive extended anaerobic incubation than the wild-type virulent organism. Thus, the Rel(Mtb) protein is required for long-term survival of pathogenic mycobacteria under starvation conditions.}

Phosphate limitation restricted {MTB} growth in a dose-dependent manner, and phosphate-starved bacilli became phenotypically tolerant to isoniazid. The {MTB} genes ppk1 and {relA} were upregulated significantly after phosphate starvation, consistent with inorganic polyphosphate accumulation and {MTB} stringent response induction.

abstract = {The differential transcriptional response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to drugs and growth-inhibitory conditions was monitored to generate a data set of 430 microarray profiles. Unbiased grouping of these profiles independently clustered agents of known mechanism of action accurately and was successful at predicting the mechanism of action of several unknown agents. These predictions were validated biochemically for two agents of previously uncategorized mechanism, pyridoacridones and phenothiazines. Analysis of this data set further revealed 150 underlying clusters of coordinately regulated genes offering the first glimpse at the full metabolic potential of this organism. A signature subset of these gene clusters was sufficient to classify all known agents as to mechanism of action. Transcriptional profiling of both crude and purified natural products can provide critical information on both mechanism and detoxification prior to purification that can be used to guide the drug discovery process. Thus, the transcriptional profile generated by a crude marine natural product recapitulated the mechanistic prediction from the pure active component. The underlying gene clusters further provide fundamental insights into the metabolic response of bacteria to drug-induced stress and provide a rational basis for the selection of critical metabolic targets for screening for new agents with improved activity against this important human pathogen.}

One regulatory mechanism for persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections is the stringent response. In this study, we analyze the stringent response of a nonpathogenic, saprophytic mycobacterial species, Mycobacterium smegmatis. The use of M. smegmatis as a tool for studying the mycobacterial stringent response was demonstrated by measuring the expression of two M. tuberculosis genes, {hspX} and eis, in M. smegmatis in the presence and absence of rel(Msm).

Here we describe the regulatory architecture of a signal transduction system involving the two-component system ({TCS}) {SenX3}-{RegX3}, the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor sigma E ({SigE}) and the poly P-synthesizing enzyme polyphosphate kinase 1 ({PPK1}). The ppk1 promoter of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is activated under phosphate starvation. This is attenuated upon deletion of an imperfect palindrome likely representing a binding site for the response regulator {RegX3}, a component of the two-component system {SenX3}-{RegX3} that responds to phosphate starvation. Binding of phosphorylated {RegX3} to this site was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The activity of the ppk1 promoter was abrogated upon deletion of a putative {SigE} binding site. Pull-down of {SigE} from M. tuberculosis lysates of phosphate-starved cells with a biotinylated {DNA} harbouring the {SigE} binding site confirmed the likely binding of {SigE} to the ppk1 promoter. In vitro transcription corroborated the involvement of {SigE} in ppk1 transcription. Finally, the overexpression of {RseA} (anti-{SigE}) attenuated ppk1 expression under phosphate starvation, supporting the role of {SigE} in ppk1 transcription. The regulatory elements identified in ppk1 transcription in this study, combined with our earlier observation that {PPK1} is itself capable of regulating {sigE} expression via the {MprAB} {TCS}, suggest the presence of multiple positive-feedback loops in this signalling circuit. In combination with the sequestering effect of {RseA}, we hypothesize that this architecture could be linked to bistability in the system that, in turn, could be a key element of persistence in M. tuberculosis.}

In mycobacteria, stresses like nutrient and oxygen deprivation activate the stress response pathway involving the two-component system {MprAB} and the sigma factor, {SigE}. {SigE} in turn activates the expression of the stringent response regulator, rel. The enzyme polyphosphate kinase 1 ({PPK1}) regulates this pathway by synthesizing polyphosphate required for the activation of {MprB}. The precise manner in which only a subpopulation of bacterial cells develops persistence, remains unknown. Rel is required for mycobacterial persistence. Here we show that the distribution of rel expression levels in a growing population of mycobacteria is bimodal with two distinct peaks corresponding to low (L) and high (H) expression states, and further establish that a positive feedback loop involving the {mprAB} operon along with stochastic gene expression are responsible for the phenotypic heterogeneity. Combining single cell analysis by flow cytometry with theoretical modeling, we observe that during growth, noise-driven transitions take a subpopulation of cells from the L to the H state within a "window of opportunity" in time preceding the stationary phase. It is these cells which adapt to nutrient depletion in the stationary phase via the stringent response. We find evidence of hysteresis in the expression of rel in response to changing concentrations of {PPK1}. Hysteresis promotes robustness in the maintenance of the induced state. Our results provide, for the first time, evidence that bistability and stochastic gene expression could be important for the development of "heterogeneity with an advantage" in mycobacteria and suggest strategies for tackling tuberculosis like targeting transitions from the low to the high rel expression state.}

Currently, there are no approved drugs that specifically target bacterial biofilms. Here we identified a potent anti-biofilm peptide 1018 that worked by blocking (p){ppGpp}, an important signal in biofilm development. At concentrations that did not affect planktonic growth, peptide treatment completely prevented biofilm formation and led to the eradication of mature biofilms in representative strains of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium and Burkholderia cenocepacia. Low levels of the peptide led to biofilm dispersal, while higher doses triggered biofilm cell death. We hypothesized that the peptide acted to inhibit a common stress response in target species, and that the stringent response, mediating (p){ppGpp} synthesis through the enzymes {RelA} and {SpoT}, was targeted. Consistent with this, increasing (p){ppGpp} synthesis by addition of serine hydroxamate or over-expression of {relA} led to reduced susceptibility to the peptide. Furthermore, {relA} and {spoT} mutations blocking production of (p){ppGpp} replicated the effects of the peptide, leading to a reduction of biofilm formation in the four tested target species. Also, eliminating (p){ppGpp} expression after two days of biofilm growth by removal of arabinose from a strain expressing {relA} behind an arabinose-inducible promoter, reciprocated the effect of peptide added at the same time, leading to loss of biofilm. {NMR} and chromatography studies showed that the peptide acted on cells to cause degradation of (p){ppGpp} within 30 minutes, and in vitro directly interacted with {ppGpp}. We thus propose that 1018 targets (p){ppGpp} and marks it for degradation in cells. Targeting (p){ppGpp} represents a new approach against biofilm-related drug resistance.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A common survival strategy of microorganisms subjected to stress involves the generation of phenotypic heterogeneity in the isogenic microbial population enabling a subset of the population to survive under stress. In a recent study, a mycobacterial population of M. smegmatis was shown to develop phenotypic heterogeneity under nutrient depletion. The observed heterogeneity is in the form of a bimodal distribution of the expression levels of the Green Fluorescent Protein ({GFP}) as reporter with the gfp fused to the promoter of the rel gene. The stringent response pathway is initiated in the subpopulation with high rel activity. {RESULTS}: In the present study, we characterise quantitatively the single cell promoter activity of the three key genes, namely, {mprA}, {sigE} and rel, in the stringent response pathway with gfp as the reporter. The origin of bimodality in the {GFP} distribution lies in two stable expression states, i.e., bistability. We develop a theoretical model to study the dynamics of the stringent response pathway. The model incorporates a recently proposed mechanism of bistability based on positive feedback and cell growth retardation due to protein synthesis. Based on flow cytometry data, we establish that the distribution of {GFP} levels in the mycobacterial population at any point of time is a linear superposition of two invariant distributions, one Gaussian and the other lognormal, with only the coefficients in the linear combination depending on time. This allows us to use a binning algorithm and determine the time variation of the mean protein level, the fraction of cells in a subpopulation and also the coefficient of variation, a measure of gene expression noise. {CONCLUSIONS}: The results of the theoretical model along with a comprehensive analysis of the flow cytometry data provide definitive evidence for the coexistence of two subpopulations with overlapping protein distributions.}

We have developed a unique in vitro model of dormancy based on the characterization of a single, large volume fermenter culture of M. tuberculosis, as it adapts to stationary phase. Cells are maintained in controlled and defined aerobic conditions (50\% dissolved oxygen tension), using probes that measure dissolved oxygen tension, temperature, and {pH}. Microarray analysis has been used in conjunction with viability and nutrient depletion assays to dissect differential gene expression. Following exponential phase growth the gradual depletion of glucose/glycerol resulted in a small population of survivors that were characterized for periods in excess of 100 days. Bacilli adapting to nutrient depletion displayed characteristics associated with persistence in vivo, including entry into a non-replicative state and the up-regulation of genes involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids and virulence. A reduced population of non-replicating bacilli went on to adapt sufficiently to re-initiate cellular division.}

However, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex ({MTBC}) strains are still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality by a single infectious disease, with 9.6 million cases and 1.5 million deaths reported. One-third of the world's population is estimated by the {WHO} to be infected with latent {TB}. During the last decade, several studies have aimed to define the characteristics of dormant bacteria in these latent infections. General features of the shift to a dormant state encompass several phenotypic changes that reduce metabolic activity. This low metabolic state is thought to increase the resistance of {MTBC} strains to host/environmental stresses, including antibiotic action. Once the stress ceases (e.g., interruption of treatment), dormant cells can reactivate and cause symptomatic disease again. Therefore, a proper understanding of dormancy could guide the rational development of new treatment regimens that target dormant cells, reducing later relapse. Here, we briefly summarize the latest data on the genetics involved in the regulation of dormancy and discuss new approaches to {TB} treatment.

One way to cope with various stress-related situations is through the activation of the stringent stress response pathway. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa this pathway is controlled and coordinated by the activity of the {RelA} and {SpoT} enzymes that metabolize the small nucleotide secondary messenger molecule (p){ppGpp}. Intracellular {ppGpp} concentrations are crucial in mediating adaptive responses and virulence. Targeting this cellular stress response has recently been the focus of an alternative approach to fight antibiotic resistant bacteria. Here, we examined the role of the stringent response in the virulence of P. aeruginosa {PAO1} and the Liverpool epidemic strain {LESB58}. A {\DeltarelA}/{\DeltaspoT} double mutant showed decreased cytotoxicity toward human epithelial cells, exhibited reduced hemolytic activity, and caused down-regulation of the expression of the alkaline protease {aprA} gene in stringent response mutants grown on blood agar plates. Promoter fusions of {relA} or {spoT} to a bioluminescence reporter gene revealed that both genes were expressed during the formation of cutaneous abscesses in mice. Intriguingly, virulence was attenuated in vivo by the {\DeltarelA}/{\DeltaspoT} double mutant, but not the {relA} mutant nor the {\DeltarelA}/{\DeltaspoT} complemented with either gene. Treatment of a cutaneous P. aeruginosa {PAO1} infection with anti-biofilm peptides increased animal welfare, decreased dermonecrotic lesion sizes, and reduced bacterial numbers recovered from abscesses, resembling the phenotype of the {\DeltarelA}/{\DeltaspoT} infection. It was previously demonstrated by our lab that {ppGpp} could be targeted by synthetic peptides; here we demonstrated that {spoT} promoter activity was suppressed during cutaneous abscess formation by treatment with peptides {DJK}-5 and 1018, and that a peptide-treated {relA} complemented stringent response double mutant strain exhibited reduced peptide susceptibility. Overall these data strongly indicated that synthetic peptides target the P. aeruginosa stringent response in vivo and thus offer a promising novel therapeutic approach.}

In mycobacteria, the (p){ppGpp} synthetase activity of bifunctional Rel is critical for stress response and persistence inside a host. Our aim was to design an inhibitor of (p){ppGpp} synthesis, monitor its efficiency using enzyme kinetics, and assess its phenotypic effects in mycobacteria. As such, new sets of inhibitors targeting (p){ppGpp} synthesis were synthesized and characterized by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We observed significant inhibition of (p){ppGpp} synthesis by {RelMsm} in the presence of designed inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner, which we further confirmed by monitoring the enzyme kinetics. The Rel enzyme inhibitor binding kinetics were investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Subsequently, the effects of the compounds on long-term persistence, biofilm formation, and biofilm disruption were assayed in Mycobacterium smegmatis, where inhibition in each case was observed. In vivo, (p){ppGpp} levels were found to be downregulated in M. smegmatis treated with the synthetic inhibitors.

In order to individually investigate the roles of (p){ppGpp} synthesis and hydrolysis during M. tuberculosis pathogenesis, we generated {RelMtb} point mutants that were either synthetase dead ({RelMtb}({H344Y})) or hydrolase dead ({RelMtb}({H80A})). M. tuberculosis strains expressing the synthetase-dead {RelMtb}({H344Y}) mutant did not persist in mice, demonstrating that the {RelMtb} (p){ppGpp} synthetase activity is required for maintaining bacterial titers during chronic infection. Deletion of a second predicted (p){ppGpp} synthetase had no effect on pathogenesis, demonstrating that {RelMtb} was the major contributor to (p){ppGpp} production during infection. Interestingly, expression of an allele encoding the hydrolase-dead {RelMtb} mutant, {RelMtb}({H80A}), that is incapable of hydrolyzing (p){ppGpp} but still able to synthesize (p){ppGpp} decreased the growth rate of M. tuberculosis and changed the colony morphology of the bacteria. In addition, {RelMtb}({H80A}) expression during acute or chronic M. tuberculosis infection in mice was lethal to the infecting bacteria.

We have cloned 1.6 kb upstream sequence of rel gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a shuttle vector {pSD5B} containing promoterless {lacZ} gene and promoter activity was observed in Mycobacterium smegmatis cells by blue/white selection and was measured by beta-galactosidase assay. In order to delineate the minimal promoter element of rel gene, a 200 bp fragment from this 1.6 kb upstream sequence was further cloned in promoterless {lacZ} shuttle vector {pSD5B} and promoter activity was observed in M. smegmatis cells in similar way. The 200 bp promoter fragment was found to be mycobacterium specific and did not respond when transformed in Escherichia coli. The +1 transcription start site was determined by primer extension method. The -10 promoter region was identified to be {TATCCT}. The three T bases when mutated, showed a remarkable decrease in the {lacZ} expression thus confirming the -10 region. The translation start site has also been identified by site directed frame shift mutagenesis. It appears that this rel promoter can be used for expression of proteins in mycobacteria.}

(p){ppGpp} rewires bacterial transcription and metabolism to cope with stress, and at high concentrations inhibits the process of protein synthesis and bacterial growth to save and redirect resources until conditions improve. Single domain Small Alarmone Synthetases ({SAS}) are {RSH} family members that contain the (p){ppGpp} synthesis ({SYNTH}) domain, but lack the hydrolysis ({HD}) domain and regulatory C-terminal domains of the long {RSHs} such as Rel, {RelA} and {SpoT}. We have discovered that multiple {SAS} subfamilies can be encoded in broadly distributed conserved bicistronic operon architectures in bacteria and bacteriophages that are reminiscent of those typically seen in toxin-antitoxin ({TA}) operons. We have validated five of these {SASs} as being toxic ({toxSASs}), and shown that the toxicity can be neutralised by six neighbouring antitoxin protein-coding genes. Thus, the {ToxSAS}-{antiToxSAS} system is a novel Type {II} {TA} paradigm comprising multiple different antitoxins, that exemplifies how ancient nucleotide-based signalling mechanisms can be repurposed as {TA} modules during evolution, potentially multiple times independently.}

abstract = {{DNA} replication is highly regulated in most organisms. Although much research has focused on mechanisms that regulate initiation of replication, mechanisms that regulate elongation of replication are less well understood. We characterized a mechanism that regulates replication elongation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Replication elongation was inhibited within minutes after amino acid starvation, regardless of where the replication forks were located on the chromosome. We found that small nucleotides {ppGpp} and {pppGpp}, which are induced upon starvation, appeared to inhibit replication directly by inhibiting primase, an essential component of the replication machinery. The replication forks arrested with (p){ppGpp} did not recruit the recombination protein {RecA}, indicating that the forks are not disrupted. (p){ppGpp} appear to be part of a surveillance mechanism that links nutrient availability to replication by rapidly inhibiting replication in starved cells, thereby preventing replication-fork disruption. This control may be important for cells to maintain genomic integrity.}

The mechanisms of {rRNA} transcriptional control in mycobacteria, which lack {DksA}, are undefined. Here we identify {CarD} as an essential mycobacterial protein that controls {rRNA} transcription. Loss of {CarD} is lethal for mycobacteria in culture and during infection of mice. {CarD} depletion leads to sensitivity to killing by oxidative stress, starvation, and {DNA} damage, accompanied by failure to reduce {rRNA} transcription. {CarD} can functionally replace {DksA} for stringent control of {rRNA} transcription, even though {CarD} associates with a different site on {RNA} polymerase. These findings highlight a distinct molecular mechanism for regulating {rRNA} transcription in mycobacteria that is critical for M. tuberculosis pathogenesis.}

Relacin inhibits {RelA} in vitro and reduces (p){ppGpp} production in vivo. Moreover, Relacin affects entry into stationary phase in Gram positive bacteria, leading to a dramatic reduction in cell viability. When Relacin is added to sporulating Bacillus subtilis cells, it strongly perturbs spore formation regardless of the time of addition. Spore formation is also impeded in the pathogenic bacterium Bacillus anthracis that causes the acute anthrax disease. Finally, the formation of multicellular biofilms is markedly disrupted by Relacin.

In particular, many of nature's most dreaded bacteria rely on nucleotide alarmones to cue metabolic disturbances and coordinate survival and virulence programs.

Stress response is often associated with dramatic accumulation of cellular guanosine tetra- or penta-phosphate (p){ppGpp} (also known as 'magic spot'), which is a key second messenger participating in regulating various biochemical and physiological processes of bacteria. Despite of the extensive studies on the mechanism of gene regulation by (p){ppGpp} during stringent response, the connection between (p){ppGpp} and bacterial steady-state exponential growth remains elusive. Here, we establish a versatile genetic approach to systematically perturb the (p){ppGpp} level of Escherichia coli through titrating either the single-function (p){ppGpp} synthetase or the singe-function (p){ppGpp} hydrolase and quantitatively characterize cell growth and gene expression. Strikingly, increased and decreased (p){ppGpp} levels both cause remarkable growth suppression of E. coli. From a coarse-grained insight, we demonstrate that increased (p){ppGpp} levels limit ribosome synthesis while decreased (p){ppGpp} levels limit the expression of metabolic proteins, both resulting in non-optimal resource allocation. Our study reveals a profound role of (p){ppGpp} in regulating bacterial growth through governing global resource allocation. Moreover, we highlight the Mesh1 (p){ppGpp} hydrolase from Drosophila melanogaster as a powerful genetic tool for interrogating bacterial (p){ppGpp} physiology. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

abstract = {{cAMP} generation in bacteria is often stimulated by sudden, but lasting, changes in extracellular conditions, whereas intracellular {cAMP} concentrations quickly settle at new levels. As bacteria lack G-proteins, it is unknown how bacterial adenylate cyclase ({AC}) activities are modulated. Mycobacterium tuberculosis has 15 class {III} {AC} genes; therefore, we examined whether mycobacteria contain a factor that may regulate {AC} activities. We identified mycobacterial polyphosphates with a mean chain length of 72 residues as highly potent inhibitors of dimeric class {IIIa}, class {IIIb} and class {IIIc} {ACs} from M. tuberculosis and other bacteria. The identity of the inhibitor was established by phosphatase degradation, {31P}-{NMR}, acid or base hydrolysis, {PAGE} and comparisons with commercial standards, and functional substitution by several polyphosphates. The data indicate that each {AC} dimer occupies 8-15 phosphate residues on a polyphosphate strand. Other polyionic polymers such as polyglutamate, polylysine and hyaluronic acid do not affect cyclase activity. Notably, the structurally unrelated class I {AC} Cya from Escherichia coli is unaffected. Bacterial polyphosphate metabolism is generally viewed in the context of stress-related regulatory networks. Thus, regulation of bacterial class {III} {ACs} by polyphosphates could be a component of the bacterial stress response.}

abstract = {Most mycobacterial species possess a full complement of genes for the biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor ({MoCo}). However, a distinguishing feature of members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex is their possession of multiple homologs associated with the first two steps of the {MoCo} biosynthetic pathway. A mutant of M. tuberculosis lacking the {moaA1}-{moaD1} gene cluster and a derivative in which {moaD2} was also deleted were significantly impaired for growth in media containing nitrate as a sole nitrogen source, indicating a reduced availability of {MoCo} to support the assimilatory function of the {MoCo}-dependent nitrate reductase, {NarGHI}. However, the double mutant displayed residual respiratory nitrate reductase activity, suggesting that it retains the capacity to produce {MoCo}. The M. tuberculosis {moaD} and {moaE} homologs were further analyzed by expressing these genes in mutant strains of M. smegmatis that lacked one or both of the sole molybdopterin ({MPT}) synthase-encoding genes, {moaD2} and {moaE2}, and were unable to grow on nitrate, presumably as a result of the loss of {MoCo}-dependent nitrate assimilatory activity. Expression of M. tuberculosis {moaD2} in the M. smegmatis {moaD2} mutant and of M. tuberculosis {moaE1} or {moaE2} in the M. smegmatis {moaE2} mutant restored nitrate assimilation, confirming the functionality of these genes in {MPT} synthesis. Expression of M. tuberculosis {moaX} also restored {MoCo} biosynthesis in M. smegmatis mutants lacking {moaD2}, {moaE2}, or both, thus identifying {MoaX} as a fused {MPT} synthase. By implicating multiple synthase-encoding homologs in {MoCo} biosynthesis, these results suggest that important cellular functions may be served by their expansion in M. tuberculosis.}

The hallmark of this response is production of guanosine tetra- and pentaphosphates, collectively termed (p){ppGpp}, which have pleiotropic effects on the bacterial physiology. As the stringent response is connected to survival under stress, it is now being targeted for developing inhibitors against bacterial persistence. The Rel enzyme in mycobacteria has two catalytic domains at its N-terminus that are involved in the synthesis and hydrolysis of (p){ppGpp}, respectively. However, the function of the C-terminal region of the protein remained unknown. Here, we have identified a binding site for {pppGpp} in the C-terminal region of Rel. The binding affinity of {pppGpp} was quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry. The binding site was determined by crosslinking using the nucleotide analog azido-{pppGpp}, and examining the crosslink product by mass spectrometry. Additionally, mutations in the Rel protein were created to confirm the site of {pppGpp} binding by isothermal titration calorimetry. These mutants showed increased {pppGpp} synthesis and reduced hydrolytic activity. We believe that binding of {pppGpp} to Rel provides a feedback mechanism that allows the protein to detect and adjust the (p){ppGpp} level in the cell. Our work suggests that such sites should also be considered while designing inhibitors to target the stringent response. \copyright 2015 {FEBS}.}

Despite intensive studies since (p){ppGpp} was discovered over 4 decades ago, (p){ppGpp} binding proteins have not been systematically identified in Escherichia coli We applied {DRaCALA} (differential radial capillary action of ligand assay) to identify (p){ppGpp}-protein interactions. We discovered 12 new (p){ppGpp} targets in E. coli that, based on their physiological functions, could be classified into four major groups, involved in (i) purine nucleotide homeostasis ({YgdH}), (ii) ribosome biogenesis and translation ({RsgA}, Era, {HflX}, and {LepA}), (iii) maturation of dehydrogenases ({HypB}), and (iv) metabolism of (p){ppGpp} ({MutT}, {NudG}, {TrmE}, {NadR}, {PhoA}, and {UshA}). We present a comprehensive and comparative biochemical and physiological characterization of these novel (p){ppGpp} targets together with a comparative analysis of relevant, known (p){ppGpp} binding proteins. Via this, primary targets of (p){ppGpp} in E. coli are identified. The {GTP} salvage biosynthesis pathway and ribosome biogenesis and translation are confirmed as targets of (p){ppGpp} that are highly conserved between E. coli and Firmicutes In addition, an alternative (p){ppGpp} degradative pathway, involving {NudG} and {MutT}, was uncovered. This report thus significantly expands the known cohort of (p){ppGpp} targets in E. {coliIMPORTANCE} Antibiotic resistance and tolerance exhibited by pathogenic bacteria have resulted in a global public health crisis. Remarkably, almost all bacterial pathogens require the alarmone (p){ppGpp} to be virulent. Thus, (p){ppGpp} not only induces tolerance of nutritional limitations and chemical insults, including antibiotics, but is also often required for induction of virulence genes. However, understanding of the molecular targets of (p){ppGpp} and the mechanisms by which (p){ppGpp} influences bacterial physiology is incomplete. In this study, a systematic approach was used to uncover novel targets of (p){ppGpp} in E. coli, the best-studied model bacterium. Comprehensive comparative studies of the targets revealed conserved target pathways of (p){ppGpp} in both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and novel targets of (p){ppGpp}, including an alternative degradative pathway of (p){ppGpp}. Thus, our discoveries may help in understanding of how (p){ppGpp} increases the stress resilience and multidrug tolerance not only of the model organism E. coli but also of the pathogenic organisms in which these targets are conserved.

Metabolomics analysis revealed that the nutrient-starved {relMtb} -deficient strain had increased metabolism similar to that of exponentially growing wild-type bacteria in nutrient-rich broth, consistent with an inability to enter quiescence. Deficiency of {relMtb} increased the susceptibility of mutant bacteria to killing by isoniazid during nutrient starvation and in the lungs of chronically infected mice.

Recent work has revealed that the transcription machinery in many bacteria diverges from the paradigm that has been established in Escherichia {coliMycobacterium} tuberculosis (Mtb) encodes the {RNA} polymerase ({RNAP})-binding protein {CarD}, which is absent in E. coli but is required to form stable {RNAP}-promoter open complexes ({RPo}) and is essential for viability in Mtb The stabilization of {RPo} by {CarD} has been proposed to result in activation of gene expression; however, {CarD} has only been examined on limited promoters that do not represent the typical promoter structure in Mtb In this study, we investigate the outcome of {CarD} activity on gene expression from Mtb promoters genome-wide by performing {RNA} sequencing on a panel of mutants that differentially affect {CarD}'s ability to stabilize {RPo} In all {CarD} mutants, the majority of Mtb protein encoding transcripts were differentially expressed, demonstrating that {CarD} had a global effect on gene expression. Contrary to the expected role of {CarD} as a transcriptional activator, mutation of {CarD} led to both up- and down-regulation of gene expression, suggesting that {CarD} can also act as a transcriptional repressor. Furthermore, we present evidence that stabilization of {RPo} by {CarD} could lead to transcriptional repression by inhibiting promoter escape, and the outcome of {CarD} activity is dependent on the intrinsic kinetic properties of a given promoter region. Collectively, our data support {CarD}'s genome-wide role of regulating diverse transcription outcomes.}

abstract = {Bacterial persisters, usually slow-growing, non-replicating cells highly tolerant to antibiotics, play a crucial role contributing to the recalcitrance of chronic infections and treatment failure. Understanding the molecular mechanism of persister cells formation and maintenance would obviously inspire the discovery of new antibiotics. The significant upregulation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv3290c, a highly conserved mycobacterial lysine \varepsilon-aminotransferase ({LAT}) during hypoxia persistent model, suggested a role of {LAT} in persistence. To test this, a lat deleted Mycobacterium smegmatis was constructed. The expression of transcriptional regulator leucine-responsive regulatory protein ({LrpA}) and the amino acids abundance in M. smegmatis lat deletion mutants were lowered. Thus, the persistence capacity of the deletion mutant was impaired upon norfloxacin exposure under nutrient starvation. In summary, our study firstly reported the involvement of mycobacterium {LAT} in persister formation, and possibly through altering the intracellular amino acid metabolism balance.}

The stringent response is mediated by the secondary messengers {pppGpp} and {ppGpp} collectively referred to as (p){ppGpp} or alarmone. In Escherichia coli , two paralogs, {RelA} and {SpoT}, synthesize (p){ppGpp}. {RelA} is activated by amino acid starvation whereas {SpoT}, which can also degrade (p){ppGpp}, responds to fatty acid({FA}), carbon and phosphate starvation. Here, we discover that {FA} starvation leads to rapid activation of {RelA} and reveal the underlying mechanism. We show that fatty acid starvation leads to depletion of lysine that, in turn, leads to the accumulation of uncharged {tRNA} lys and activation of {RelA}. {SpoT} was also activated by fatty acid starvation but to a lower level and with a delayed kinetics. Next, we discovered that pyruvate, a precursor of lysine, is depleted by {FA} starvation. We also propose a mechanism that explains how {FA} starvation leads to pyruvate depletion. Together our results raise the possibility that {RelA} may be a major player under many starvation conditions previously thought to principally depend on {SpoT}. Interestingly, {FA} starvation provoked a \~100-fold increase in {relA} dependent ampicillin tolerance.}

It is necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying the survival of microbes under stress, as they may eventually aid in the successful control of the growth and persistence of these organisms.

The hallmark of the stringent response is the accumulation of guanosine tetra- ({ppGpp}) and pentaphosphates ({pppGpp}), which probably bind {RNA} polymerase to regulate gene expression at certain promoters. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the stringent responses of other microbes, with a view to correlating it with sporulation, virulence and long-term persistence.}

In addition to the classic activation of the stringent response, it has become evident that (p){ppGpp} exerts differential effects on cell physiology in an incremental manner rather than simply acting as a biphasic switch that controls growth or stasis. Of particular interest is the intimate relationship of (p){ppGpp} with persister cell formation and virulence, which has spurred the pursuit of (p){ppGpp} inhibitors as a means to control recalcitrant infections.

For such systems, we showed that reachability and safety verification problems can be formulated and solved (conservatively) in an elegant and computationally inexpensive way, based on the fact that multi-affine functions on rectangular regions of the space are determined at the vertices. Using these techniques, we study the stringent response system, which is the transition of bacterial organisms from growth phase to a metabolically suppressed phase when subjected to an environment with limited nutrients.}

abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a successful pathogen that overcomes numerous challenges presented by the immune system of the host. This bacterium usually establishes a chronic infection in the host where it may silently persist inside a granuloma until, a failure in host defenses, leads to manifestation of the disease. None of the conventional anti-tuberculosis drugs are able to target these persisting bacilli. Development of drugs against such persisting bacilli is a constant challenge since the physiology of these dormant bacteria is still not understood at the molecular level. Some evidence suggests that the in vivo environment encountered by the persisting bacteria is anoxic and nutritionally starved. Based on these assumptions, anaerobic and starved cultures are used as models to study the molecular basis of dormancy. This review outlines the problem of persistence of M. tuberculosis and the various in vitro models used to study mycobacterial latency. The basis of selecting the nutritional starvation model has been outlined here. Also, the choice of M. smegmatis as a model suitable for studying mycobacterial latency is discussed. Lastly, general issues related to oxidative stress and bacterial responses to it have been elaborated. We have also discussed general control of {OxyR}-mediated regulation and emphasized the processes which manifest in the absence of functional {OxyR} in the bacteria. Lastly, a new class of protein called Dps has been reviewed for its important role in protecting {DNA} under stress.}

Despite this onslaught of attacks, Mtb is able to persist for the lifetime of the host, indicating that this pathogen has substantial molecular mechanisms to resist host-inflicted damage. The stringent response is a conserved global stress response in bacteria that involves the production of the hyperphosphorylated guanine nucleotides {ppGpp} and {pppGpp} (collectively called (p){ppGpp}). (p){ppGpp} then regulates a number of cellular processes to adjust the physiology of the bacteria to promote survival in different environments. Survival in the presence of host-generated stresses is an essential quality of successful pathogens, and the stringent response is critical for the intracellular survival of a number of pathogenic bacteria. In addition, the stringent response has been linked to virulence gene expression, persistence, latency and drug tolerance. In Mtb, (p){ppGpp} synthesis is required for survival in low nutrient conditions, long term culture and during chronic infection in animal models, all indicative of a strict requirement for (p){ppGpp} during exposure to stresses associated with infection. In this review we discuss (p){ppGpp} metabolism and how this functions as a critical regulator of Mtb virulence.}
